<h2>Kraken SDR DoA DSP</h2>
This software is intended to demonstrate the direction of arrival (DoA) estimation capabilities of the KrakenSDR and other RTL-SDR based coherent receiver systems which use the compatible data acquisition system - HeIMDALL DAQ Firmware.
<br>
<br>
The complete application is broken down into two main modules in terms of implementation, into the DAQ Subsystem and to the DSP Subsystem. These two modules can operate together either remotely through Ethernet connection or locally on the same host using shared-memory.

Running these two subsystems on separate processing units can grant higher throughput and stability, while running on the same processing unit makes the entire system more compact.

<h3>Installation</h3>
<h4> Remote operation </h4>
To install the DoA DSP software for remote operation you can simply use the prepared install script after cloning the repository.

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/krakenrf/krakensdr_doa
sudo ./krakensdr_doa/util/setup_init.sh
```

<h4>Local operation</h4>
To run entire data acquisition and processing chain on the same host you have to install both subsystems separately.

1. Clone the repository of the HeIMDALL DAQ Firmware and follow the install instructions from the readme. (https://github.com/krakenrf/heimdall_daq_fw)
2. Clone this repsitory to the same folder and run the installation script.
  *krakensdr_doa/util/setup_init.sh*
3. Copy the the *krakensdr_doa/util/kraken_doa_start.sh* and the *krakensdr_doa/util/kraken_doa_stop.sh* scripts into the root folder of the project.

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/krakenrf/heimdall_daq_fw
sudo ./heimdall_daq_fw/util/install.sh
./heimdall_daq_fw/util/eeprom_init.sh
git clone https://github.com/krakenrf/krakensdr_doa
sudo ./krakensdr_doa/util/setup_init.sh
cp krakensdr_doa/util/kraken_doa_start.sh .
cp krakensdr_doa/util/kraken_doa_stop.sh .
```

<h3>Configuration</h3>
The DSP parameters such as the antenna configuration, the used DoA estimation method and the default RF parameters of the data acquisition chain can be configured by editing the settings.json either manually or by the use of the software after starting it. 

 
<h3>Running</h3>

<h4>Remote operation</h4>

1. Start the DAQ Subsystem either remotely. (Make sure that the *daq_chain_config.ini* contains the proper configuration) 
    (See:https://github.com/krakenrf/heimdall_daq_fw/Documentation)
2. Set the IP address of the DAQ Subsystem in the settings.json, *default_ip* field.
3. Start the DoA DSP software by typing:
`./run.sh`
4. To stop the server and the DSP processing chain run the following script:
`./kill.sh`

<h4>Local operation</h4>

You can run the complete application on a single host either by using Ethernet interface between the two subsystems or by using a shared-memory interface. Using shared-memory is the recommended in this situation. 
1. Make sure that the *daq_chain_config.ini* contains the proper configuration
(See:https://github.com/krakenrf/heimdall_daq_fw/Documentation)
2. Set *data_interface="shmem"* in the settings.json
3. Start the full systems by typing:
`./kraken_doa_start.sh`
4. To stop the full systems run the following script:
`./kraken_doa_stop.sh`

<p1> After starting the script a web based server opens at port number 8051, which then can be accessed by typing "127.0.0.1:8050/" in the address bar of any web browser. You can also get access to the web interface remotely on the same network by replacing the IP address of the server. </p1>
